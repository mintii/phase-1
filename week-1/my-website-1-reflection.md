**Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.**

Creating and cloning repositories is great because it allows you to work from your computer and upload changes online.

You can create a repository by navigating to github.com, making an account and following directions after clicking *+New repository*

Your repository now esists on github but in order to work on it we need to get it on your computer. 

Inside your repository on github.com you should see an https link. 
copy it and open your command line or bash.

once inside the directory of choice you will type (git clone https://link.git) 

press enter and the repository on github should now be available to you on your computer!

**Describe what open source means.**

Open source shares how a program was made. This lets developers make any changes they'd like to the program in order for it to fit their needs.
Source code is made available to the public and distribution must be free.

**What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or 
protective? Does it feel like utopia?**

I love the idea of open source. Open source software is great because it gives people an opportunity to get started with something new without having to spend money on software. This lets people experiment right away without making a financial commitment on something they are not sure they'll end up using often. 
Open source code is great because it lets developers tweak programs and make tools that fit their own workflow. 

**Assess the importance of using licenses.**

Licencing grants sepecific permissions for other people to use the work.
This lets people know what they are aloud to do with the work and hoe to use it.

**What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**

This challenge was fun because I was able to play with github repositoies and throw an html page on the internet. This challange reassured my comfort with git and github.

**Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**

Creative commons was mentioned at the end of the article "A Short Guide to Open-Source"
Most artists including myself are using creative commons licenses on their work because lots of great music is being taken off the internet as a result of containing a certain sample or even part of a vocal thats been manipulated. Creative commons has become popular on sites like Soundcloud because it gives artists who dont intend to make money more room to breathe and enables them to post their songs for the world to hear, recive feedback, and grow a fan base without interferance. 
I've been using creative commons but I never looked into what its really about. I'm glad I took the time to reasearch because I now support the licence twice as much.
