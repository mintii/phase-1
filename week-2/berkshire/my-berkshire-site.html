<!-- 
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
	It was fun. I liked messing with emmet to throw in the unordered list with links all at once. 
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
	It was fun because I never realized how much easier they make styling. In my opinion they also help organize the hmtl document its self.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
	I think I did alright. I threw in a header, nav and div tags so the site is easier to style with css.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
	HTML is a markup language and thats all. What I find good about html is the option for external style sheets. To be able to style the page according to its elements that can be called by classes and id's is great because it keeps everything clean, organized and allows for smaller documents. 

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
	I always remind myself that html goes from the top to bottom. It's a markup language so it's important to get down the basics and wait untill every thing is layed out before adding style.
